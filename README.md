# MP2 COMP472 by The Skynet Team

The purpose of this project is to implement three different search algorithms while recreating the game Rush Hour.

## Step1:
Ensure that the "Sample-input" is in the same directory folder as the MP2.ipynb  
## Step 2: 
Use Anaconda to begin your Jupyter Notebook session in either the online version or the VS code version (your choice).
## Step3:
After everything has been loaded, you must click run on the first section of code to load the text file.
Once that it done, you must choose the demo version of your choice as shown in the code snipet below:

## Step5:
Once you have chosen your demo version, simply click run all once again to get your results for that specific demo version.
## Step6:
View the output files within the same directory.
